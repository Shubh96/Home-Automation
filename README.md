# Home-Automation
## Designing Idea of the Product
The idea is to design a system that can be used to remotely control any electrical appliance at you home, be it fans at lights at your home or be it washing machines, oven or any other appliance.
It gives you complete control of your home in your hand. *But, don't confuse it with home automation.* We haven't automated anything at our home. **Automation** means that every appliance will operate smartly like your assistant.
